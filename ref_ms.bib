	abstract = {Computational simulation of biological processes can be a valuable tool in accelerating biomedical research, but usually requires extensive domain knowledge and manual adaptation. Recently, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have proven surprisingly successful for a wide range of tasks by generating human language at a very large scale. Here we explore the potential of leveraging LLMs as simulators of biological systems. We establish proof-of-concept of a text-based simulator, SimulateGPT, that uses LLM reasoning. We demonstrate good prediction performance for various biomedical applications, without requiring explicit domain knowledge or manual tuning. LLMs thus enable a new class of versatile and broadly applicable biological simulators. This text-based simulation paradigm is well-suited for modeling and understanding complex living systems that are difficult to describe with physics-based first-principles simulation, but for which extensive knowledge and context is available as written text.Competing Interest StatementCB is a cofounder and scientific advisor of Aelian Biotechnology and Neurolentech.

                  gene expression via direct base pairing with their mRNA
                  targets. Current prediction approaches identified that between
                  20 to 60\% of mammalian transcriptomes are regulated by
                  miRNAs, but it remains largely unknown which fraction of these
                  interactions are functional in a specific cellular context.
                  Here, we integrated transcriptome data from a set of
                  miRNA-depleted mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines with
                  published miRNA interaction predictions and AGO-binding
                  profiles. This integrative approach, combined with molecular
                  validation data, identified that only 6\% of expressed genes
                  are functionally and directly regulated by miRNAs in mESCs. In
                  addition, analyses of the stem cell-specific miR-290-295
                  cluster target genes identified TFAP4 as an important
                  transcription factor for early development. The extensive
                  datasets developed in this study will support the development
                  of improved predictive models for miRNA-mRNA functional
                  interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have
