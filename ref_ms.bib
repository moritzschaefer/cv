  abstract =     {MicroRNA (miRNA) loaded Argonaute (AGO) complexes regulate
                  gene expression via direct base pairing with their mRNA
                  targets. Current prediction approaches identified that between
                  20 to 60\% of mammalian transcriptomes are regulated by
                  miRNAs, but it remains largely unknown which fraction of these
                  interactions are functional in a specific cellular context.
                  Here, we integrated transcriptome data from a set of
                  miRNA-depleted mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines with
                  published miRNA interaction predictions and AGO-binding
                  profiles. This integrative approach, combined with molecular
                  validation data, identified that only 6\% of expressed genes
                  are functionally and directly regulated by miRNAs in mESCs. In
                  addition, analyses of the stem cell-specific miR-290-295
                  cluster target genes identified TFAP4 as an important
                  transcription factor for early development. The extensive
                  datasets developed in this study will support the development
                  of improved predictive models for miRNA-mRNA functional
                  interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have
